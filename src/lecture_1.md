# Lecture 1

## Plan

- To master the use of docker and various programming languages
- To have a deeper understanding of the genome, especially non-coding RNA
- To lay a foundation for future scientific research with the help of bioinformatics technology

## Notes

- Gene
  - coding
  - non-coding *Why do humans have so few genes?* **science & technology(RNG)**
- Method
  - Sequencing:Nanopore, Single Molecule Real-time, etc.
  - Computing
- 3 steps of Bioinformatics
  - Information:images,sequences;
  - Model:the representations or structures that capture the underlying patterns or relationships in data
  - Algorithm:the instructions or rules that define how to solve a problem
- Two types of Bioinformatics studies:
  - Data Problems
  - Biology Problems
